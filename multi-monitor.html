  I find that my productivity is roughly linear in the amount of screen real estate that I have to work with.  I had always laughed at people who used multiple monitors-it seemed incredibly wasteful to me, in that you cannot read text from much more than a postage-stamp sized bit of monitor at a given time anyway, and most online media looks terrible at large size.  I write this on the 2nd from the left of my current 4-monitor setup, and I am seriously considering upgrading to 5 or 6.  Much like a restrictive programming language or other poor tools, small screen real estate diminishes productivity by causing you to work around it unconsciously.  It takes only a few seconds to move between, say, Visual studio and a browser, but that few seconds is enough of a hindrance that I find I will try something instead of going back to the documentation.  Experimentation in place of documentation works fine in a dynamic language like lisp, or scheme, or python, but in C, it is a killer.

  I find that I cannot usefully work with N monitors for N keyboard/mouse combos.  I need one set of controls and a lot of screen.  The way I do this now is with a dual-head windows box and a dual head linux box, communicating by x2vnc.  I have considered getting an X server on the windows box and using x2x, but I have not seen a significant advantage to doing so.

  One difficulty I faced in getting this configuration working is that I had to get Gentoo working with a 2-head ATI card.  This turned out to be challenging.  I found an excellent FAQ at <a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Dual_Monitors" > gentoo howto dual monitors</a>.  If anyone finds this useful, I'd love to hear about it.
