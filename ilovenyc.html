This morning, like most mornings, I walked to work, from deepest, darkest chinatown to the far more fashionable Soho.  On the way, I saw a stunning young woman waiting outside a clothing store.  I decided to walk back, and take a second look, not yet having gotten any restraining orders during the weekend.  On my way back, I barged through a photo-op, not noticing until the flash fired.  When I turned to apologise, I saw that the cameraman had the strangest flash I had ever seen-it was a circle around the lens-some sort of professional gear, I assume.  The subject of the photo was some model or other, impossibly tall and thin, with a somewhat unplugged look between shots.  The only thing that made this at all remarkable was that the photographer turns out to be significant other of one of my friends-who I was going to see that night.  It always amazes me how small a villiage New York is.
