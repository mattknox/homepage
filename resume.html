      <h1>Professional Experience:</h1>
      <h4>www.sermo.com - Cambridge, MA. February 2008 - April 2009</h4>
      <div class='job'>
	<h6>Technical staff</h6>
	<p>Sermo was a company with a large J2EE codebase whose CEO wanted to switch to Ruby on Rails.  I came on to write code myself, teach and mentor employees coming up to speed on ruby, and grow the local ruby community while strengthening the Sermo's connection to it.  While teaching classes internally, externally, and at MIT, I worked in teams or solo on a number of different applications (a rewrite of the registration process, a jobsboard, a national influenza tracker, integration with bloomberg, and a survey system for docs) and pushed internally for a number of process changes, including rapid prototyping, short release cycles, and greater involvement by programmers further up the chain of decisions.

      <h4>www.jango.com - New York, NY. November 2006 - February 2008</h4>
      <div class='job'>
	<h6>Technical staff</h6>
	<p>After being contacted by a nontechnical founder with an idea on a napkin, I proposed and documented the architecture(REST on RoR+lighttpd+fastCGI+mysql+memcache) of a social music site, then hired a team of 5 other programmers while prototyping and implementing the site.  Post launch, I optimized and scaled the site.  As of mid-November 2007, the site had grown to 80K registered and .5M total users.  Mid-December, 180K registered users and ~1.3M total.

      <h4>AdModus - New York, NY. December, 2005 - December, 2006</h4>
      <div class='job'>
	<h6></h6>
	<p>I designed, wrote and operated a large subset of a system that optimizes ad delivery at the level of individual advertisements, using numerous different traffic and advertisement sources.  This system brought a $10/day account to $3000/day, and made feasible several forms of advertising arbitrage.  Researched text classification and wrote a text classifier as part of a project to write a behavioral targeting system for ads.
Documented that system as part of spinning off the company, which resulted in acquisition.

      <h4>Direct-Revenue - New York, NY.</h4>
      <div class='job'>
	<h6>Manager of Defensive technologies, September, 2004 - December, 2005</h6>
	<p>Performed technical analysis of company and competitor software to find vulnerabilities, and then ameliorated the former and exploited the latter.  Designed, tested and rolled out software intended to improve persistence on the desktop. Shipped approximately 30 million copies of this software, in various versions. Wrote software to remove competitors from client machines. Wrote encryption software in java for server-side recreation of obfuscated names. Developed further hiding and persistence mechanisms, including invisible processes, unreadable registry keys, virtual processes, and remote thread injection. Architected these obfuscation and persistence capabilities into a platform that achieved nearly a 100% gain in persistence, in the face of increased competitor and antivirus attention. Embedded a highly customized version of the Tinyscheme language as a scripting runtime.

	<h6>Lab director</h6>
	<p>Developed protocols for an industrial flow-cytometry lab, including sample preparation, Hoechst staining, media preparation, safety, and freezing.  Sorted bovine semen to assure sex of offspring, and conducted a quality assurance program, including training employees, testing media and apparatus, and testing product.  The resulting product was cut due to lack of funding.

      <h4>Milagro/Sleator labs, New York, NY</h4>
      <div class='job'>
	<h6></h6>
	<p>Designed, diagrammed, built, and documented electronic devices for an extremely low temperature optical trapping apparatus. (Optical trapping is confining a thin gas with lasers-in this case rubidium at approx -273C). Designed and implemented a sound-suppression device for a vacuum system related to the experiment, designed and set up a water-cooling system for the apparatus, and demonstrated flaws in the lab security that were subsequently fixed. Wrote a Fortran program for the analysis of survey data. Determined the correct timing information for an array of photomultiplier tubes that made up the detection apparatus for a TeV scale cosmic gamma-ray detector.
